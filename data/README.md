## **Microphone Setup**

## Run 1

4 microphones were setup at the corners of a 30.5 inch high by 65.5 inch wide rectangle. 

1: top left
2: bottom left
3: top right
4: bottom right  

1-3 are Logitech C922 Webcams, 4 is a CAD U37.

The first section of the data is calibration. The speaker is placed equidistant from all the microphones. Next the speaker is placed directly in front of each microphone in order 1-4. The speaker is turned off between each movement. Everything after this is test data.

A quick check in Audacity showed about 5" of error.
